<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkezlmzn1/image/upload/v1684926269/git-banner_ibboid.png"/>
FirstRole is a web app to help new software engineers land the first tech role! The major reason new software developers struggle to get their first role in tech is often due to lack of experience. Most companies don’t want to invest time, money and resources into training one, only to lose them once they’ve gained experienced. 

So they opt for someone that is already market ready, instead of risking it. And as such new developers keep getting rejected by tech companies due to lack of experience.
FirstRole aims connects startups with new software developers who are willing to work for free.

The architecture consist of two main parts: the front end and the back end. The front end was developed using Bootstrap framework which provide the user interface for the FirstRole web application. The back end was created using the Django framework which handle the logic, and database operations.
