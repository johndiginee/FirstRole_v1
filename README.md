#  FirstRole - Your Journey To Getting your First Role Tech 
The major reason new software developers struggle to get their first role in tech is often due to lack of experience. Most companies don’t want to invest time, money and resources into training one, only to lose them once they’ve gained experienced. 

So they opt for someone that is already market ready, instead of risking it. And as such new developers keep getting rejected by tech companies due to lack of experience.
FirstRole aims connects startups with new software developers who are willing to work for free.
